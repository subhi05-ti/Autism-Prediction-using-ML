# Autism-Prediction-using-ML

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using behavioral and demographic data.
The project explores various classification algorithms to build an accurate and interpretable ASD prediction model.

##  About the Project

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition that affects communication, behavior, and social interaction.
Early detection is crucial for timely intervention and better long-term outcomes.

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict ASD from screening data (such as AQ-10 test scores and medical history).
The goal is to assist in preliminary screening, **not to replace clinical diagnosis**.

##  Features

Some of the features in the dataset:

- `A1` to `A10`: Responses to 10 autism screening questions
- `Age`: Age of the participant
- `Gender`: Male/Female
- `Ethnicity`: Ethnic background
- `Jaundice`: Whether the individual had jaundice at birth
- `Family_mem_with_ASD`: Family history of autism
- `Country_of_res`: Country of residence
- `Result`: AQ score
- `Class/ASD`: **Target** variable (ASD = Yes or No)
